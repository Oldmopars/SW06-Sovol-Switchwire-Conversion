# SW06-Sovol-Switchwire-Conversion
Here it is. Until I can come up with a better name, I am calling it the SW06 (Switchwire/SV06). 
I had a few goals with this build. 
To reuse as many as possible of the original SV06 parts. At this point nearly all of the hard parts and electronics are being used, including the frame. Nearly all the plastic injection molded parts are replaced with printed parts. 
I wanted to make it better, faster and eliminate the Z banding issues. That is why the 		   CoreXZ. However, per the first goal, I am reusing the now unused X axis motor and putting it in the Y axis to have 2 Y axis motors. More power, and shorter belt path between motors. 
I wanted to be able to enclose it, but not require anything super complex to do so. I want to print ABS/ASA and other high temp filaments. This is one of the main reasons to base it off the Switchwire. Premade SW panel kit fits, it was designed around it. The only panel that will not fit is the deck panel, and it is now 3D printed in 6 parts to fit the SV06 print area. 
Easy upgrade path to an even better or faster machine. All of the Voron compatible toolheads including the Stealth Burner, XOL2, Dragon Burner, etc. will fit this now as it uses the Voron Mount system. This also means you can use TAP R8, CNC Tap, Beacon, Eddy, Klicky, etc. 
A budget to fit any wallet. There are 3 main options. First one is the Basic. This uses the stock 8mm Rods and LM8UU bearings in the Z, only requires 1 MGN12 linear rail. You will also need some F695 bearings, new belts and some hardware. If you do not have a RPi or some other Klipper screen, you will need that to convert to Klipper. This will keep the spend under $100 and reuse the stock hot end. 
If you can afford more, the enclosure is next. This will be a bit under $100. So, the basic, plus enclosure will cost between $150-200. 
The Full Monty. Here you add the MGN12 rails in the Z axis to full SW configuration. Add a Voron Tool Head with any upgrades you want. Add your choice of Probe, LEDs, MIC6 bed, and maybe even MGN12 for the bed.  Want to add a filter? Heater? Camera? 48mm motors? 48V with TMC5160â€™s? Sky is the limit and many of the options from the Switchwire will directly work on this. 
 I am still cleaning up the CAD files. Due to using the Voron as a base, moving fasteners around has been a royal pain, so most of the fasteners are not shown. I will be working to add these all in, but it will take time. 
  If anyone would like to build a BETA version, let me know and I will share the files with you. I would love to have some others build it first and help me flush out any issues I may have overlooked. 
  I look forward to sharing this with you all and hope to see many of these printers converted and doing great things. 

Please keep in mind that this is a BETA. I have yet to convert a full printer and so much of this is untested. Please feel free to use these files and let me know if anything needs to be fixed or changed. I would love to get feedback and see your builds.
